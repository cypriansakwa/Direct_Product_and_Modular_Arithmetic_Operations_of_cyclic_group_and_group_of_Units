This Rust code shows operations on the direct product of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the group of units $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$. It offers capability for generating elements of these groups, performing modular arithmetic on their direct product, calculating element products, and determining an element's inverse.

## Features
- **Generate Elements of $\mathbb{Z}_n \times \mathbb{Z}_m^*$:** Create all elements in the direct product of the cyclic group $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and the group of units $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$.
- **Modular Arithmetic Operations:**
   - Element Product: Compute the product of two elements in the direct product group, with results modulo $n$ and $m$.
   - Element Inversion: Find the inverse of an element in the direct product group.

  ## Installation

- To use this project, you need to have Rust installed on your machine.
- If Rust is not installed, follow the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) to install it.
- After installing Rust, clone this repository or copy the code into a Rust project, Compile and run the code using cargo run.
## Usage
- You can change the values of $n$ and $m$ in the main function to work with different cyclic groups. Furthermore, the code can be modified to perform various functions or interact with user input.
- The program computes and displays the direct product of $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and $\mathbb{Z}_m^*$, which are predefined in the code. It will also show the sum of two elements and the inverse of an element from the direct product group.
